### Basic City Information


**Chittagong**, situated on the southeastern coast of Bangladesh, is the country's second-largest city and a critical economic hub. Nestled between the Bay of Bengal and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, its strategic geographical location has played a pivotal role in shaping its cultural and economic significance.

The city experiences a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by high temperatures, heavy rainfall, and distinct wet and dry seasons. Summers are hot and humid, often exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), while the monsoon season, from June to October, brings intense rainfall and occasional cyclones. The winter months, from November to February, are relatively dry and more comfortable.

Chittagong's urban development reflects its economic importance. The city boasts a skyline marked by a mix of modern skyscrapers, commercial centers, and residential buildings. Infrastructure has seen improvements, with well-developed road networks, bridges, and public transportation systems. Despite these advancements, challenges such as traffic congestion and environmental concerns persist.

Economically, Chittagong is a vital center for Bangladesh. The Chittagong Port, one of the busiest in the region, facilitates international trade, connecting the country to global markets. The port handles diverse goods, including textiles, garments, raw materials, and machinery. The industrial sector, encompassing shipbuilding, steel production, and petrochemicals, significantly contributes to the local economy.

The Chittagong Export Processing Zone (CEPZ) attracts foreign investment, hosting industries involved in garment manufacturing, electronics, and other export-oriented enterprises. The city's service sector has also flourished, with a focus on banking, finance, and commerce. Various financial institutions, corporate offices, and trading houses contribute to the bustling commercial activities, defining Chittagong as a dynamic economic center.
